# Dina Font TTF Remastered
This repository contains a hand-modified version of the original 10pt [Dina Bitmap Font,](https://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/) converted to TTF format to increase its accessibility. The goal is to have as close to a one-to-one conversion as possible for main-use text.

Other TTF conversions of this font can be found online, but most have severe artifacts as they're not manually adjusted afterwards. For me at least, this makes those converted fonts unusable.

All basic alphanumeric characters have been correctly copied with correct spacing. All commonly used symbols are correctly copied. **Non-english characters are not guaranteed to be copied correctly and may still contain artifacting.** One or two characters that were missing (like the Euro) were added.

There is an accompanying bold font which is nearly a 1:1 copy of the original.

Note that Microsoft's Cleartype system causes a notable visual difference in clarity between bitmap and non-bitmap versions. This has to be adjusted on your end, there's nothing I can do about it. Some text editors and IDEs can directly override the system font smoothing option internally, so you can look into that option if you don't want to modify the entire system's smoothing.

# Installation
Download the DinaRemasterCollection.ttc font and install it to your system in whatever way is needed (real specific, I know!)

**Set your font size to 12 wherever you use this font for proper scaling.**
