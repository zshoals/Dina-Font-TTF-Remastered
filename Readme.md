# Update 12/20/2020
A slight edit of the original Dina font has been added to this repository as well. The original, DinaRemasterCollection.ttc, is still available, and is still a direct copy of Dina. However, DinaRemasterII.ttc contains a few edits. The + sign has been enlarged by 1px in all directions, the = sign has been spaced out by 1px vertically, and Z has had its slash portion rearranged to make it appear less like the number 2.

There's no comparison images added for these changes, so all comparisons are from Dina to DinaRemasterCollection.ttc.
# Dina Font TTF Remastered
This repository contains a hand-modified version of the original 10pt [Dina Bitmap Font,](https://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/) converted to TTF format to increase its accessibility. The goal is to have as close to a one-to-one conversion as possible for main-use text.

Other TTF conversions of this font can be found online, but most have severe artifacts as they're not manually adjusted afterwards. Others are "hacks" that maintain the bitmap elements of the original but do not function **at all** if any scaling is applied. For me at least, this makes those converted fonts unusable.

All basic alphanumeric characters have been correctly copied with correct spacing. All commonly used symbols are correctly copied. **Non-english characters are not guaranteed to be copied correctly and may still contain artifacting.** One or two characters that were missing (like the Euro) were added.

There is an accompanying bold font which is nearly a 1:1 copy of the original.

Note that Microsoft's Cleartype system causes a notable visual difference in clarity between bitmap and non-bitmap versions. This has to be adjusted on your end, there's nothing I can do about it. Some text editors and IDEs can directly override the system font smoothing option internally, so you can look into that option if you don't want to modify the entire system's smoothing.

# Installation
Download the DinaRemasterCollection.ttc font collection and install it to your system in whatever way is needed (real specific, I know!)

**Set your font size to 12 wherever you use this font for proper scaling.**
